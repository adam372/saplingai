    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 650px; color: #6B705C; margin-bottom: 40px;">
        We believe growth doesn't have to be loud. The strongest brands are
        built quietly — with understanding, patience, and purpose. Every
        solution we create is rooted in clarity and long-term value.

            <h3>Intentional Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                We start by understanding your business deeply, aligning every
                decision with your goals and values.

            <h3>Thoughtful Design</h3>
            <p>
                Our design approach is minimal and meaningful — focused on
                clarity, usability, and lasting impact.

            <h3>Sustainable Growth</h3>
            <p>
                We help brands grow in ways that feel natural, adaptable, and
                built to evolve over time.

    <h2>Why STEP</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 650px; color: #6B705C;">
        STEP exists to simplify complexity. We partner with brands who value
        intention over trends and want to build something that lasts. Every
        project is treated as a collaboration — not just a service.
